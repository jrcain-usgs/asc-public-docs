## Introduction

[Autoseed](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/autoseed/autoseed.html)
is a program that will automatically build a gridded network of evenly
distributed tiepoints across overlapping polygons. The distance between
the tiepoints is defined in meters, or number of points along the major
axis and minor axis. Autoseed requires the success of ISIS3's
[spiceinit](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/spiceinit/spiceinit.html),
[footprintinit](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/footprintinit/footprintinit.html)
and
[findimageoverlaps](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/findimageoverlaps/findimageoverlaps.html)
applications. The collection of tiepoints are further refined with other
ISIS3 programs, and used to improve the geometric accuracy of the input
images.

## Overlap Polygons

![Colorful polygons overlap each other with varying degrees of transparency.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/overlap-polygon-example.png 
  "ISIS3 qmos image footprint plot of Clementine images."){ align=right width=300 }

The automatic seeding program is dependent on the information about how
all the images to be combined into a single output overlap each other.
The polygons can be different shapes and sizes. A separate program 
(**findimageoverlaps**) attempts to find all the polygons and saves the
information to an output file. This output file is defined as the
*overlap* parameter in **autoseed**. This image shows the
overlap polygons in different shades of color.



## Available Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best for:                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grid**  | different shapes and sizes of overlap polygon                                 |
| **Limit** | limiting the number of seeded tiepoints per polygon                           |
| **Strip** | rectangular shaped overlap polygons such as those for adjacent line scan data |

The standard autoseed templates for the three algorithms are in
`$ISIS3DATA/base/templates/autoseed/`

## Required Parameters for each Algorithm

The required parameters for each algorithm are provided through a
separate **Parameter Value Language** (PVL) definition file.

### MinimumThickness

![Vertical slightly tilted rectangles overlap each other. A sliver where two rectangles barely overlap each other is pointed out.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/ctx-footprint-plot-cropped-demo.png 
  "Simple Polygons"){ width=250 align=left }

!!! tip

    Setting the **MinimumThickness** parameter will most likely work better 
    for these polygons. If boxes were drawn around the polygons they would be 
    similar to the shape of the original polygons.

The MinimumThickness is used to exclude seeding tiepoints within
polygons that are narrow slivers. If the thickness value is below the
defined minimum thickness, then no tiepoints are seeded within the
polygon. The valid values are between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default value
is 0.0 if nothing is entered. The thickness value is derived by drawing
a box around the polygon, and calculating the ratio of the short side by
the long side of the box. The MinimumThickness option works best if the
polygons are rectangular or square shapes. Use this parameter with
caution because the calculated value for thickness may not be accurate.

-----

### MinimumArea

![Outlined polygons. Narrow Slivers are pointed out.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/narrow-sliver-polygon-example.png 
  "Polygon types"){ width=300 align=left }

The MinimumArea is used to specify what the smallest calculated value
for the minimum area of an overlap polygon must be in order to seed
tiepoints. The default value is 0.0 if nothing is entered for
MinimumArea. This parameter is useful for excluding small and skinny
overlap polygons from being seeded with tiepoints.

!!! tip

    1. Set the **MinimumArea** to avoid seeding tiepoints in polygons 
    formed by narrow slivers overlapping.
    
    1. **MinimumThickness** might be misleading for these polygons; 
    its estimate would be too large.

-----

### *XSpacing* & *YSpacing*

The *grid* and *strip* algorithms require the user to define XSpacing
and YSpacing, and if nothing is entered the program will report an error
and fail. The XSpacing and YSpacing parameters are defined in meters,
and determine how the tiepoints will be distributed within each polygon.
The tiepoints are seeded starting at the center of each polygon, and
spaced every XSpacing increment along the X-axis, and YSpacing increment
along the Y-axis. The resolution of the input images will contribute to
how dense the tiepoints are seeded. See Examples.

### *MajorAxisPoints* & *MinorAxisPoints*

These two parameters are only used for the *Limit* algorithm. The
MajorAxisPoints is used to specify how many tiepoints to seed along the
longer side of a box drawn around the polygon. The MinorAxisPoints is
used to specify how many tiepoints to seed along the shorter side of a
box drawn around a polygon. So, if you set MajorAxisPoints = 10 and
MinorAxisPoints = 3, then you would have 30 equally spaced tiepoints (10
rows by 3 columns or 3 rows by 10 columns) within each of the overlap
polygons.


## Preparing for autoseed (run these programs first)
#### These must be run on individual input images:

|   | Program           | Purpose                                                               |
|---|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **spiceinit**     | attaches SPICE data to the ISIS3 cube                            |
| 2 | **footprintinit** | adds image footprint information to ISIS3 cube labels            |
| 3 | **camstats**      | attaches geometric and image statistics to the ISIS3 cube labels |

#### *findimageoverlaps* needs a list of images as input:

|                       |                                                                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **findimageoverlaps** | determines all the overlap polygons among all the images in the input list |

## Deciding which algorithm to use

The first step is to display the images you have selected to see how
they overlap each other using either PILOT, qmos, or some other display
method. The overlap polygons are areas where a unique set of images
overlap each other. The complexity of the polygons across your mosaic
area will determine which algorithm is the most appropriate to use.

### Examples:

![PILOT Webpage showing overlapping long blue rectangles on a map of Mars.  
  The rectangles criss-cross and are not all pointed the same way.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/upc-ctx-search-for-footprint-reduced.png 
  "Astrogreology UPC image search"){ align=left width=300 }

#### Non-uniform order and size → *Grid*

The image footprints are not in a uniform order, and the size of the images 
varies. The `Grid` algorithm would be the best to use for this data.

(This image shows rendered footprints in [PILOT](http://pilot.wr.usgs.gov/).)

![Overlapping colored rectangles on white. The rectangles are taller 
  than they are wide.  Some rectangles are shorter than others.  The 
  rectangles are all pointed the same way.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/ctx-footprint-plot.png 
  "ISIS3 qmos image footprint plot"){ align=left width=300 }

#### Same resolution but different sizes → *Limit* or maybe *Strip*

The resolution of the images are about the same, but
the ground area that was imaged varies in size. The strips of CTX
linescan data are adjacent to each other, and the overlap polygons are
simple and easily identified. The `Limit` algorithm would be the easiest
to use. You would need to decide how many points to seed along the
longest side of the overlap polygon and how many points across the
shorter side. The `Strip` algorithm will provide more evenly distributed
set of tiepoints, but you will need to figure out the most appropriate X
and Y spacing.

-----

![Overlapping colored rectangle outlines on white. They are oriented 
  like an Asian paper fan or seats in an auditorium towards an unmarked 
  point in the bottom left. The rectangles are more concentrated closer
  to the point. The rectangles are all similar in size.](
    ../../assets/control-networks/clem-footprint-plot.png 
    "Clem footprint Plot"){ align=left width=300 }

#### Same resolution and size, varying overlaps → *MinimumArea* + *Grid* or *Strip*

The resolution of the images are about the same. The
size of the overlap polygons vary in shape, orientation, and sizes. It
would be best to specify the `MinimumArea` to eliminate many of the
smaller polygons from getting seeded. The best option would be to use
either `Grid` or `Strip` algorithm to avoid clustered points in the smaller
polygons. The `MinimumArea` can be increased if there are too many points
clustered together in the smaller polygons, and the spacing can also be
increased to put a greater distance between the seeded tiepoints.

-----

![A cluster of overlapping colored rectangle outlines around an unmarked 
  centerpoint.  The rectangles are more concentrated towards the center.](
  ../../assets/control-networks/clem-polar-footprints.png 
  "Clem Plar Footprints"){ align=left }

#### Complex overlaps → Manual Approach with *seedgrid*

The overlap polygons here are so complex that
`findimageoverlaps` will fail, and `autoseed` cannot be run. In this
case, the only option is to use the program `seedgrid` to generate a
network of seeded tiepoints. The `seedgrid` program does not require
prior knowledge of the overlap polygons, but does require latitude
range, longitude range, and a map template.

-----

## Determining XSpacing and YSpacing

It is important to know the range of resolutions for the images you wish
to include. Decide how many tiepoints you want to seed across the longer
side and shorter side of the overlap polygons. For example, let’s say
most of the polygons have 50 pixels of overlap along the shortest width
and 5000 pixels along the longest length and the median resolution is 6
meters/pixel, and you have decided to seed 3 points across the shorter
side and 10 points along the longer side of the polygons. The
calculation for the spacing would be the following:

    X-spacing = (50/(3 + 1)) * 6  =  75m
    y-spacing = (5000/(10 + 1)) * 6 = ~2727m (round up to 2800m)

The second option is to display two images whose overlap pattern is
representative of most of the images in the mosaic using ISIS3 **qview**
program. The following is an example of the **qview** measurement tool,
depicted as a ruler on the right side, to measure the distance of the
widest overlap area:

!!! danger "TODO - Update link"

    TODO: Update **Using Qview to view cubes** link once that page is migrated.

See [Using Qview to view cubes](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/docs/concepts/isis-fundamentals/introduction/#introduction-to-isis) for more
information about **qview**.

![Measurement tool on two side-by-side Clementine images to show the overlap area](
  ../../assets/control-networks/qview-moreoverlap-measure-for-spacing-calculation.png "Clem overlap 1")

The tool measured approximately 278 pixels. The resolution of these two
images are around 190 meters/pixel. So, the calculation for XSpacing
would be ((278 pixels/6) \* 190 m/pixel) resulting in 8803.3 meters. You
could start with XSpacing and YSpacing equal to 8800 meters as a
starting point, and then increase or decrease the number based on
whether you want to increase or decrease the distance between the seeded
tiepoints.

![Measurement tool on two side-by-side Clementine images to show the overlap area](
  ../../assets/control-networks/qview-measure-for-spacing-calculation-indexcolor.png "Clem overlap 2")

This example shows the measurement for the shorter side of the polygon,
which is about 86 pixels. Sometimes the spacing increments you select
may need to be different in the x and y directions, especially for line
scan data where the image has a lot more lines than samples. If the
desire is to seed only two tiepoints along the shorter side then your
calculation would be ((86 pixels/3) \* 190 m/pixel) giving an xspacing
of 5446 meters. You could use 5500 meters for x-spacing and 8800 meters
for y-spacing.

## Running Autoseed

!!! example "Command Line Interface"

    In your terminal, type `autoseed` followed by `parameter=value` for each parameter as shown:
    ```sh
        autoseed fromlist=lev1.lis deffile=clem_grid2_autoseed.def overlaplist=overlaps.lis onet=autoseed_grid.net errors=autoseed_grid.err networkid=Clementine1 pointid=C?????? description="Clementine grid1"
    ```

??? example "Graphical Interface"

    ![A form with an input space for each parameter.](../../assets/control-networks/autoseed-gui-2012.png "Autoseed GUI")

## Output

The output file is a binary control network (cnet) file that contains
the control pointids and control measurements of all the images that
overlap each seeded tiepoint. The program **qmos** can be used to
display the images, image footprints, and the control network to see how
the tiepoints are distributed. If the distribution of tiepoints is too
dense, increase the spacing between the tie points to spread them apart
and to reduce the number of tiepoints. If the tiepoints are too sparse
then decrease the spacing to add more tiepoints. Rerun **autoseed** each
time the parameters in the PVL definition file are changed. When you
have reached an acceptable solution then use the program **qnet** to
evaluate and refine the tiepoints by loading the control network file.

The output network can no longer be viewed by a text editor unless the
network file has been converted to a PVL format with **cnetbin2pvl** ,
but use caution if the file size is large. The second option is to use
**cneteditor** to view the network file in the binary format.

**Converting binary control network to PVL format:**

```sh
cnetbin2pvl from=hirise_set1_autoseed.net to=hirise_set1_autoseed_pvl.net
```

        XSpacing = 10000
        YSpacing = 10000

    The spacing increment for both X and Y directions are the same due to
    the similar shapes of the overlap polygons. The `MinimumArea` was defined
    to limit clustered tiepoints.

    ![Autoseed automatically seeded tiepoints for Clementine images](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-grid2-autoseed.png

    The spacing increment decreased by a factor of two so more tiepoints can
    be automatically seeded. It was desirable to have more tiepoints due to
    the fact that we are working with data near the South Pole where there
    are more areas in shadows than normal.

??? example "Coarse *Strip*"

    ![Autoseed automatically seeded tiepoints for Clementine images](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-strip1-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_strip1_autoseed"){ align=right width=450 }

    **Autoseed PVL definition file for *Strip* algorithm**

        Name = Strip
        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 10000000
        XSpacing = 10000
        YSpacing = 10000

    The spacing increment for both X and Y directions are the same due to
    the similar shapes of the overlap polygons. The `MinimumArea` was defined
    to limit clustered tiepoints. The result is very similar to the grid
    algorithm and some of the tiepoints are seeded in difference locations.

??? example "Fine *Strip*"

    ![Autoseed automatically seeded tiepoints for Clementine images](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-strip2-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_strip2_autoseed"){ align=right width=450}

    **Autoseed PVL definition file for *Strip* algorithm**

        Name = Strip
        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 10000000
        XSpacing = 5000
        YSpacing = 5000

    The spacing increment decreased by a factor of two so more tiepoints can
    be automatically seeded. It was desirable to have more tiepoints due to
    the fact that we are working with data near the South Pole where there
    are more areas in shadows than normal. There are more tiepoints
    clustered along polygon boundaries for this test.

??? example "Limit example"

    #### Starting Point

    ![Clem_limit1_autoseed](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-limit1-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_limit1_autoseed"){align=right width=450 }

        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 10000000
        MajorAxisPoints = 6
        MinorAxisPoints = 3

    -----

    #### Step 1

    ![Clem_limit2_autoseed](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-limit2-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_limit2_autoseed"){ align=right width=450 }

        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 10000000
        MajorAxisPoints = 3
        MinorAxisPoints = 1

    The number of points for the major and minor axis were reduced to seed
    fewer tiepoints.

    -----

    #### Step 2

    ![Clem_limit3_autoseed](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-limit3-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_limit3_autoseed"){ align=right width=450 }

        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 20000000
        MajorAxisPoints = 3
        MinorAxisPoints = 1

    The MinimumArea was doubled to eliminate tiepoints in the small
    polygons.

    -----

    #### Step 3

    ![Clem_limit4_autoseed](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-limit4-autoseed.png 
      "Clem_limit4_autoseed"){ align=right width=450 }

        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 50000000
        MajorAxisPoints = 3
        MinorAxisPoints = 1

    The MinimumArea was increased again to remove more tiepoints from the
    small polygons.

    -----

    #### Step 4

    ![Clem_limit5_autoseed](
      ../../assets/control-networks/clem-limit5-autoseed.png 
    "Clem_limit5_autoseed"){ align=right width=450 }

        MinimumThickness = 0.0
        MinimumArea = 75000000
        MajorAxisPoints = 3
        MinorAxisPoints = 1

    The MinimumArea was increased even further to eliminate tiepoints that
    were still too close together especially along the polygon boundaries.

## Seedgrid

The last option is to utilize **seedgrid** instead of **autoseed** if
**findimageoverlaps** fails. This method seeds tiepoints without relying
on the overlap polygons. The program will seed tiepoints across a
specified area based solely on the spacing provided by the user, either
in x/y spacing or lat/lon increment. The output file will contain the
PointId and the latitude and longitude coordinate associated with each
pointid. This option is also useful if your data set includes images
with a wide range of resolutions, or if the limb or terminator in the
image.

!!! example "Running seedgrid on the command line"

    ```
    seedgrid target=Mars minlat=0 maxlat=5 minlon=0 maxlon=6 spacing=latlon latstep=1 lonstep=1 networkid=Seedgrid1 pointid=Mars_seedgrid_??? onet=seedgrid.net description="Seedgrid latinc=1 loninc=1"
    cnetbin2pvl from=seedgrid.net to=seedgrid_pvl.net
    ```
    

??? abstract "Partial contents of seedgrid control network file"

        Object = ControlNetwork
          NetworkId    = Seedgrid1
          TargetName   = Mars
          UserName     = elee
          Created      = 2012-06-01T11:07:49
          LastModified = 2012-06-01T11:07:49
          Description  = "Seedgrid latinc=1 loninc=1"
          Version      = 3

          Object = ControlPoint
            PointType   = Free
            PointId     = Mars_seedgrid_001
            ChooserName = seedgrid
            DateTime    = 2012-06-01T11:07:49
            Ignore      = True

            # AprioriLatitude = 0.0 <degrees>
            AprioriX    = 3396190.0 <meters>

            # AprioriLongitude = 0.0 <degrees>
            AprioriY    = 0.0 <meters>

            # AprioriRadius = 3396190.0 <meters>
            AprioriZ    = 0.0 <meters>
          End_Object

          Object = ControlPoint
            PointType   = Free
            PointId     = Mars_seedgrid_002
            ChooserName = seedgrid
            DateTime    = 2012-06-01T11:07:49
            Ignore      = True

            # AprioriLatitude = 1.0 <degrees>
            AprioriX    = 3395672.7438132 <meters>

            # AprioriLongitude = 0.0 <degrees>
            AprioriY    = 0.0 <meters>

            # AprioriRadius = 3396190.0 <meters>
            AprioriZ    = 59271.688218238 <meters>
          End_Object

The next step would be to run **cnetadd** to add new control measurement
for the images in your input list.

    ls *lev1.cub > lev1.lis
    cnetadd cnet=seedgrid.net addlist=lev1.lis onet=seedgrid_cnetadd.net tolist=cnetadd_output.lis log=seedgrid_cnetadd.log modifiedpoints=modified.lis polygon=yes retrieval=point

Continue with control registration with **pointreg** or other cnet
programs.

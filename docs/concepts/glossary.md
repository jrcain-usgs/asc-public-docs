The origin is at the center of mass for the target and the axes rotate and move through space with the body. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin is non-constant. Many body-fixed coordinate systems, or reference frames, are defined in NAIF PCK files.

The origin is at the center of the sensor and the axes rotate and move through space with the sensor. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin is non-constant. The location of the center of a spacecraft and its instruments at a given time are defined in NAIF SPK files. Generally, one or more frames are associated with a particular instrument.

The formula for estimating this value works well if the image is taken near nadir, but the accuracy falls off rapidly the farther off-nadir the image is taken. For an estimate that handles off-nadir images with higher accuracy, one should use

## O

### Oblique Detector Resolution
This provides an improved estimate to the standard detector resolution when the image is taken at an oblique angle. In Figure 1A below, an image of the Dufay X crater that was taken near nadir is displayed. Figure 1B is a color map showing the relative difference between the oblique detector resolution, and the original detector resolution as a function of the emission angle. For small emission angles (near nadir) the relative difference between the two estimates is very small. For larger emission angles (off-nadir), the relative difference between the two estimates increases rapidly. Figure 2A is an image of the Carlini crater group taken at an oblique angle. Figure 2B is a color plot of the relative difference between the two estimates showing a minimum of approximately 120% when the emission angles off-nadir are in the range 64-75 degrees. The traditional approximation is obviously not adequate for a case such as this, and the oblique detector resolution should be used.

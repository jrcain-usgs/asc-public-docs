## A

### Adjusted
The term, Adjusted, refers to the output pixel coordinate or output geographic location within a control network. Applications such as pointreg or jigsaw report and update the "Adjusted" output pixel coordinate (pointreg) or geographic location (jigsaw) in the output control network. 
### Albedo

### A Priori
The term, "A Priori", refers to the initial or original value of a pixel coordinate or geographic location within a control network. Applications such as pointreg or jigsaw refer to the a priori values for an input pixel coordinate (pointreg) or geographic location (jigsaw) in an input control network. 
### Azimuth

## B

### Band
A 3rd dimensional layer of pixels in an image, typically representing spectral information. The number of bands indicates the depth of an image in terms of these layers.

### Bit Type
Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an image cube file. 
### Body Fixed Coordinate
A planetary coordinate system where the coordinates are not time varying. 
### Body-Fixed Coordinate System
A body-fixed coordinate system is used to determine positions and directions of objects and vectors with respect to a target body. The origin is at the center of mass for the target and the axes rotate and move through space with the body. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin is non-constant. Many body-fixed coordinate systems, or reference frames, are defined in NAIF PCK files. 
### Byte
Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On most modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically, computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number. 

## C

### Camera Coordinate System
A camera coordinate system is used to determine positions and directions of objects and vectors with respect to a sensor (i.e. camera). The origin is at the center of the sensor and the axes rotate and move through space with the sensor. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin is non-constant. The location of the center of a spacecraft and its instruments at a given time are defined in NAIF SPK files. Generally, one or more frames are associated with a particular instrument. 
### Control Island

### Control Point

### Cube
A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).

### Declination
Declination (Dec) is one of two angles of the North Pole of a target body as a function of time. 
### Detector Resolution
The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge of a detector. If the lines and samples are not being summed and averaged, this value is equal to the pixel resolution. The formula for estimating this value works well if the image is taken near nadir, but the accuracy falls off rapidly the farther off-nadir the image is taken. For an estimate that handles off-nadir images with higher accuracy, one should use 
### Digital Number
The numeric value of a single pixel in an image. The value may represent almost any unit. For example: reflectance (I/F), radiance, elevation, or radius. Digital Numbers (DNs) can be discrete integers or floating point values.

## F

## G

### Ground Azimuth
A clockwise angle between one reference point and another reference point. Each pixel location has a latitude and longitude associated with it (ground point). The only information required to calculate a ground azimuth is to form a spherical triangle from three points on the planet (ground point, North Pole, and point of interest). The point of interest is often the sub-spacecraft or sub-solar point. Spherical trigonometry is then used to calculate the angle.

For images that have a body (i.e. not star fields), this vector is parallel to the line from the sensor to the observed point on the surface of the target. The look direction can be represented in any of several coordinate systems, including: Body-fixed coordinate system, Camera coordinate system, J2000 coordinate system.

## O

### Oblique Detector Resolution
This provides an improved estimate to the standard detector resolution when the image is taken at an oblique angle. In Figure 1A below, an image of the Dufay X crater that was taken near nadir is displayed. Figure 1B is a color map showing the relative difference between the oblique detector resolution, and the original detector resolution as a function of the emission angle. For small emission angles (near nadir) the relative difference between the two estimates is very small. For larger emission angles (off-nadir), the relative difference between the two estimates increases rapidly. Figure 2A is an image of the Carlini crater group taken at an oblique angle. Figure 2B is a color plot of the relative difference between the two estimates showing a minimum of approximately 120% when the emission angles off-nadir are in the range 64-75 degrees. The traditional approximation is obviously not adequate for a case such as this, and the oblique detector resolution should be used.
### Oblique Line Resolution

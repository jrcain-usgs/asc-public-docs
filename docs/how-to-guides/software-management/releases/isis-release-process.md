# ISIS Public Release Process

!!! info "For releasing other Astro software, see the [general release process :octicons-arrow-right-16:](general-release-process.md)"
  
The ISIS release process changes depending on the type of release.  Release Candidates (RCs) and Live Releases are only done for Major Releases (i.e, 8.x.x → 9.0.0). 

- **RC** (Release Candidate)
    - Major releases are released first as RCs  
      (e.g. going from ***8***.3.0 → ***9***.0.0)
* **LR** (Live Release)
    - If no changes are suggested for the RC after a month,  
      **do a LR from the RC**.

Subsequent Production and LTS releases (with no Major version change, i.e, 8.***2***.0 → 8.***3***.0, 9.0.***1*** → 9.0.***2***), have a more streamlined release process, with no RC/LR.

* **LTS** (Long Term Support)
    - The previous major release is supported for a year in LTS.
    - Only receives bug fixes, no feature adds. 

* **Prod** (Production)
    - Quarterly release with (non-breaking) features and bugfixes.

------

### 1. **Prepare Feeder Branch/Merge Any Unmerged Changes**

=== "RC"

    - [ ] Before starting, any new features for the Major Release should have been pushed to the `dev` branch.
    - [ ] Create a branch for the RC and push it to the upstream repo.
        - For RC1, create branch from `dev`.  
          `git checkout -b 8.0.0_RC1 upstream/dev`
        - For RC2, RC3, etc, branch from the previous RC.  
          `git checkout -b 8.0.0_RC2 upstream/8.0.0_RC1`
    - [ ] For your local branch, set it to track your own git repo:  
      `git push -u origin 8.0.0_RC1`  
      so later you can make a PR to the upstream branch (`upstream/8.0.0_RC1`).

    (`dev` is the feeder branch for `8.0.0_RC1`, `8.0.0_RC1` is the feeder branch for `8.0.0_RC2`.)

=== "LR"

    - [ ] Preparation has already been done in the RC process.  (The RC is the feeder branch for a Live Release.)

=== "LTS"

    - [ ] Checkout the LTS release feeder branch for the major version (i.e, `9-lts`)
    - [ ] The ISIS github actions auto-cherrypick ***bugfixes*** to this branch.  Note which ones have been successfully cherrypicked.
    - [ ] **Manually cherrypick** any bugfixes from `dev` that could not be automatically merged by the github actions.

=== "Prod"

    - [ ] Checkout the Prod release feeder branch for the major version (i.e, `9-prod`)
    - [ ] The ISIS github actions auto-cherrypick ***bugfixes*** and ***non-breaking features*** to this branch.  Note which ones have been successfully cherrypicked.
    - [ ] **Manually cherrypick** any bugfixes/features from `dev` that could not be automatically merged by the github actions.

!!! Success ""

    Move on to step 2 after any functional changes have been merged.

### 2. **Check current test failures**

Check the [AWS CodeBuild test results](https://us-west-2.codebuild.aws.amazon.com/project/eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiNDJNZ2MxbHFKTkwxV1RyQUxJekdJY3FIanNqU29rMHB4Nk1YUzk4REIrZUZDeEtEaW9HQlZ1dTZOSHpML2VUTGVDekYydmVFcU9sUHJKN20wQzd1Q0UzSzJscnB0MElDb1M3Ti9GTlJYR1RuMWJTV3V1SkJTa3NoYmc9PSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6IjF3U2NTSGlDcEtCc29YVnEiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D) for the branch you plan to release. If false positives are suspected, at least two contributing developers need to agree before moving forward. 

!!! Success ""
    
    Move on to step 3 after **confirming that builds are passing** (or **accounting for false positives**).

### 3. **Update the GitHub documents**

=== "RC" 

    - [ ] Update the Changelog. Label all the currently unreleased changes as part of this release. See comments on the  [CHANGELOG.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DOI-USGS/ISIS3/dev/CHANGELOG.md) for instructions. 
    - [ ] Update `code.json` by adding a new entry with the RC version. e.g. an 8.0.0 release candidate would be labeled `8.0_RC1` for the first RC, `8.0_RC2` for the second, etc. 
    - [ ] **Update the Authors List**:  If there are any new contributors to the project since the last release, update the `AUTHORS.rst` file to include them.
    - [ ] Submit a Pull Request: Submit a pull request into the current RC's upstream branch (i.e. `upstream/8.0.0_RC1`).

=== "LR"

    - [ ] Update the Changelog: Update the release date on the version to be released in the changelog. See comments on the  [CHANGELOG.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DOI-USGS/ISIS3/dev/CHANGELOG.md) for instructions. 
    - [ ] Update `code.json` by adding a new entry with the new version number and the date last modified.   
    - [ ] **Update the Authors List**:  If there are any new contributors to the project since the last release, update the `AUTHORS.rst` file to include them.
    - [ ] Submit a Pull Request:  Submit a pull request into the current RC's upstream branch (i.e. `upstream/8.0.0_RC1`).

=== "LTS"

    - [ ] Update the Changelog. Move **only the bug fixes** under this release. Follow the instructions in [CHANGELOG.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DOI-USGS/ISIS3/dev/CHANGELOG.md) for how to do this.
    - [ ] Update `code.json` by adding a new entry with the LTS version. e.g. an 8.0.0 LTS would be released as 8.0 (no LTS in the version name).
    - [ ] **Update the Authors List**:  If there are any new contributors to the project since the last release, update the `AUTHORS.rst` file to include them.
    - [ ] Submit a Pull Request: Submit a pull request into the LTS release feeder branch (i.e, `9-lts`). 

=== "Prod"

    - [ ] Update the Changelog. Move **only bug fixes and non-breaking features** under this release. Follow the instructions in [CHANGELOG.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DOI-USGS/ISIS3/dev/CHANGELOG.md) for how to do this.
    - [ ] Update `code.json` by adding a new entry with the Prod version.
    - [ ] **Update the Authors List**:  If there are any new contributors to the project since the last release, update the `AUTHORS.rst` file to include them.
    - [ ] Submit a Pull Request: Submit a pull request into the Prod release feeder branch (i.e, `9-prod`). 


!!! Success "" 
    
    Move on to step 4 after **merging PR(s)** to the feeder branch. 

### 4. **Create/Setup Release Branch**

Clone the repo locally with git clone. 

=== "RC" 

    - [ ] *Working from your local branch for the RC (i.e, `8.0.0_RC1`)...*
    - [ ] Update VERSION variable in CMakeLists.txt, do not add `_RC` here.
    - [ ] Update RELEASE_STAGE variable in CMakeLists.txt to `beta``
    - [ ] Update `recipe/meta.yaml` to match the name of the RC branch. i.e. **with** the `_RC#`.
    - [ ] Update the `build` section by copying the current contents of `environment.yaml` into the `build` section. 
    - [ ] Update the `run` section to include any new packages and remove any packages that are no longer needed. 
    - [ ] Push the changes to the upstream branch (`upstream/8.0.0_RC1`)

=== "LR" 

    - [ ] *Working from your local branch for the RC (i.e, `8.0.0_RC1`)...*
    - [ ] Check VERSION variable in CMakeLists.txt matches release version.
    - [ ] Update RELEASE_STAGE variable in CMakeLists.txt to `stable`.
    - [ ] Update `recipe/meta.yml` to match the LR version. i.e. **without** the `_RC#`.
    - [ ] Update the `run` section to include any new packages and remove any packages that are no longer needed. Rare for LRs, often no changes are needed. 
    - [ ] Push the changes to the upstream branch
    - [ ] Create the LTS and Prod feeder branches for this major version of isis and push them to the upstream repo.  
        ```
        git checkout -b 8-lts upstream/8.0.0_RC1
        git push -u upstream 8-lts

        git checkout -b 8-prod upstream/8.0.0_RC1
        git push -u upstream 8-prod
        ```

=== "LTS"

    - [ ] Checkout a branch from the LTS feeder branch.
        * Example: `git checkout -b 9-lts upstream/9-lts`.
    - [ ] Update VERSION variable in CMakeLists.txt.
    - [ ] Check RELEASE_STAGE variable in CMakeLists.txt is set to `stable`.
    - [ ] Update the `run` section to include any new packages and remove any packages that are no longer needed.
    - [ ] Push to the upstream feeder branch (`upstream/9-lts')

=== "Prod"

    - [ ] Checkout a branch from the Prod feeder branch.
        * Example: `git checkout -b 9-prod upstream/9-prod`.
    - [ ] Update VERSION variable in CMakeLists.txt.
    - [ ] Check RELEASE_STAGE variable in CMakeLists.txt is set to `stable`.
    - [ ] Update the `run` section to include any new packages and remove any packages that are no longer needed.
    - [ ] Push to the upstream feeder branch (`upstream/9-prod`)

!!! Danger "Ensure to update the version and build_number is set to 0 in recipe/meta.yml"

    The build number should be incremented for each build produced at the **same version** of source code and should always begin at 0 for each release version. **Uploading the a new build using the same build number AND version number will overwrite the previous release**.

??? Note "meta.yml vs environment.yml versions"
     Make sure you look closely at the changes in terms of syntax. Our `environment.yaml`s seem to have a looser restriction than what is expected in the `meta.yaml`. Check out conda's [package match specifications](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/package-spec.html#package-match-specifications) for more info.        

!!! Success ""
    Move on to step 5 after **creating the new branch on the upstream repo**. 


### 5. **Update Version in AWS S3** (for [ISIS Application Docs](https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov))

!!! info "Not for RC.  For LR, LTS, and Prod."

- [ ] Add the new version to `versions.json` in AWS S3  
    `arn:aws:s3:::asc-public-docs/isis-site/versions.json`

!!! Success "" 
    
    Move on to step 6 after **updating versions.json**. 


### 6. **Create a release**

=== "RC"

    !!! Warning "No Release for RCs"

        **Skip this step for Release Candidates (RCs).** Only pull a release if it's a full release (i.e. LR/LTS/Prod, NOT an RC). RCs should instead be in their own branch until ready for full release.  

=== "LR" 

    - [ ] In the release tab on GitHub, draft a release and set the target branch to the branch created in Step 4.
    - [ ] On the same page, create a new tag for the release version.
    - [ ] Name the release "ISISX.Y.Z Public Release".

=== "LTS"

    - [ ] In the release tab on GitHub, draft a release and set the target branch to the branch created in Step 4.
    - [ ] On the same page, create a new tag for the release version.
    - [ ] Name the release "ISISX.Y.Z LTS". 

=== "Prod"

    - [ ] In the release tab on GitHub, draft a release and set the target branch to the branch created in Step 4.
    - [ ] On the same page, create a new tag for the release version.
    - [ ] Name the release "ISISX.Y.Z Production". 

!!! note ""

    Tag **custom** builds as **pre-release**, including ***mission-specific*** and ***non-standard*** builds.
 
!!! success ""

    Move on to step 7 after **creating the release**. 

### 7. **Publish Record to DOI**

!!! info "LR/LTS/Prod only, not for RCs."

- [ ] Check that the code.usgs.gov link for the release is live and create a DOI record.
